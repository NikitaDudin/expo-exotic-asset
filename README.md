# Why

I ran into a problem that the static textures in the expo-tree are not loaded in the release build on the android platform. This solution circumvents this issue.

A texture from a static asset file works fine in debug mode. But doesn't work in Android release mode.

# Installation

```
npm install expo-exotic-asset
```

```
yarn add expo-exotic-asset
```

# Usage

* `resolveExoticAsync` returns a promise that resolves a expo Asset or null

```ts
const asset = await resolveExoticAsync(require('asset/img.png)); // Asset or null
```

* `resolveExoticPathAsync` same as resolveExoticAsync but returns a promise that resolves file uri string or null

```ts
const uri = await resolveExoticPathAsync(require('asset/img.png)); // string or null
```
